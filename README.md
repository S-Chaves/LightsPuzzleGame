# Welcome to my Lights Puzzle Game
This is a fun little game where the goal is to turn on all the lights, but clicking on one of them changes the state of the others around it.

You can play it [here](https://s-chaves.github.io/LightsPuzzleGame/).

## About
It all started with the idea in my head of a simple game where you have to turn on all the lights. I'm somewhat new to coding and it sounded like a creative game so I decided to try and do it. Every time I finished with some part of the game more ideas kept coming and that's how I came to this point.

This is my very first Proyect and I've only been coding for 4 months, so if anyone wants to contribute with it, by suggesting changes to the code or features that I could add it would mean a lot for me.

 Right now the game is far from done, I have some things in mind that I would like to add to make it more fun and enjoyable, but it's playable and that's why I decided to upload it to GitHub.
