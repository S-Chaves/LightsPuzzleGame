# Welcome to my Lights Puzzle Game
This is a fun little game where the goal is to turn on all the lights, but clicking on one of them changes the state of the others around it.

## About the Proyect
It all started with the idea in my head of a simple game where you have to turn on all the lights. I somewhat new to coding and it sounded like a creative game so I decided to try and do it. Every time I finished with some part of the game more ideas kept coming and that's how I came to this point.

This is my very first Proyect and I've only been coding for 4 months, so if anyone wants to contribute with it, by suggesting changes to the code or features that I could add it would mean a lot for me.

 Right now the game is far from done, I have some things in mind that I would like to add to make it more fun and enjoyable, but it's playable and that's why I decided to upload it to GitHub.
